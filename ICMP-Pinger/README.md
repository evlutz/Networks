# ICMP Pinger

## Description

Welcome to the Advanced ICMP Pinger project! This project is part of the Computer Networks course (CS4516) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The objective is to develop a Ping application using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to gain a deeper understanding of IP and ICMP packet structures and familiarize with the ICMP protocol. The Ping application will test host reachability across IP networks by sending ICMP "echo request" packets and listening for ICMP "echo reply" responses.

## Features

* **ICMP Ping Implementation** : Develop a robust Ping client that sends ICMP echo requests and receives echo replies to measure round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss.
* **Real-time Network Testing** : Test network interfaces and connectivity to various hosts, including local and remote servers.
* **Enhanced Statistics Reporting** : Calculate and display minimum, maximum, and average RTTs for comprehensive latency analysis.
* **ICMP Error Handling** : Parse and display ICMP response error codes for improved network diagnostic
